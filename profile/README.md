It would be great for humanity if AI replaced doctors ASAP.

Human doctors are forced to memorize a lot of information, are relatively poor at retrieving it, and frequently make mistakes.

In addition, the system is completely rigged to restrict supply.

AI is far better than humans at these tasks and makes fewer mistakes. The sooner we can adopt AI in healthcare, the better.

At Super Medical Intelligence Lab, we’re creating safe, cost-efficient, and multimodal Medical AI outperforms humans.
